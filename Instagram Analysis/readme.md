# Analysis of my Instagram Account

#### Problem Statement :
I have downloaded data from my Instagram Account. This data 5-6 files. I'll use the below 3 files for my furtehr analysis:
#### 1. media.json - Contains data about my uploads (stories,pics and videos)
#### 2. connections.json - Contains data about followers/following
#### 3. likes.json - Contains about about who I liked

Instagram does not provide data

I have also created a Shiny App of the Exploratory Data Analysis I have done on the data for better understanding

[Shiny App for my Instagram Analysis](https://yatinkode.shinyapps.io/instaproject/)

```
Note: Since Instagram does not provide any information about usage statistics, we cannot really forecast
the usage of my Instagram in the future. I have considered the number of likes I do every moment
as a usage statistics and forecast the likes done by me on any post/video etc. in the future 6 months.
I have the data of my account from May, 2014 to December, 2018. I will forecast the values of 
my usage(likes done) for the months of January 2019 to June 2019
