# Analysis of my Instagram Account

#### Problem Statement :
I have downloaded data from my Instagram Account. This data 5-6 files. I'll use the below 3 files for my furtehr analysis:
#### 1. media.json - Contains data about my uploads (stories,pics and videos)
#### 2. connections.json - Contains data about followers/following
#### 3. likes.json - Contains about about who I liked

I have also created a Shiny App of the Exploratory Data Analysis I have done on the data for better understanding
